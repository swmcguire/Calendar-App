# Calendar-App

## Description

Being that work has been ramping up and its been more difficult to stay on schedule with the additional tasks it would be nice to have a daily calendar that I can update so I can stay on task all day.

When I open the calendar App I will be able to see the current date and time.  I am then able to write updates within the different time blocks for what needs to get done during that timeframe.  When the time falls within the current time block the schedule will display a red tint, if the time block is in the past it will display a grey tint, and if the time block is in the future it will display green.

Since the tasks will be stored in the local storage, I will be able to refresh the page and it will pull in the calendar detail when I refresh the page.

This project was helpful to understand dayJS - I feel that was the easiest part of the assignment.  Getting the correct blocks to display the correct colors and saving to local storage proved to be a bit more difficult than I originally thought it would.

## Installation

No installation necessary - simply launch from the designated webpage and begin using.  You are able to type in the different text boxes and save the text to the local storage.  Once you refresh the page the text will return so you know what needs to be done for the day.

## Usage

Once you launch the website from the designated webpage you can begin using the calendar.  You are able to type in the different text boxes and save the text to the local storage.  Once you refresh the page the text will return so you know what needs to be done for the day.
